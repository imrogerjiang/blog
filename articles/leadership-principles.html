    <article>
        <p>Before we begin, here’s a quick question:
How many of us have completed a piece of work only to find it’s not what the manager was looking for? How about a subordinate going off in a completely wrong direction? Often times, we take responsibility for these miscommunications, however they many be exacerbated by poorly defined company values.</p>
<p>Company decisions are made at the top, but to be realised, need to be implemented piecewise. Each large strategic decision made by the CEO needs to divided up and filtered through the management hierarchy. At each level the instructructions broken up piecewise and passed to the next level until the instructions are small enough to be implemented by a single person. It is no wonder then that with many layers of management (6-7 in the case of Amazon) that intent will be lost in translation.</p>
<p>This is where company values seeks to make a difference. If we view company values as heuristics for the overall direction of the company such that employees at any level are able to align their actions to the company’s, then the utility of a company’s core values becomes clear. Employees working in Amazon, for example, can argue their case based on the principle of “Customer Obsession”. They may ask “Who would these changes benefit?” and “What aspect of the customer’s lives improved as a result?” As such, they would be more likely to contribute to their manager’s overall objectives and less miscommunication would result.  </p>
<p>I scoured the core values of Amazon and Netflix and these three values resonated with me the most because these were the values I have yet to be good at:</p>
<h4 id="amazon-are-right-a-lot">Amazon: Are Right, A Lot<a class="headerlink" href="#amazon-are-right-a-lot" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<h4 id="netflix-judgement">Netflix: Judgement<a class="headerlink" href="#netflix-judgement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Both Amazon and Netflix include strong judgement and being correct as an important value of leadership. This one seems obvious to the point of absurdity, however they both also point at how to be right more often; Amazon suggests to seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm your beliefs while Netflix suggests to use data and identify root causes. For me personally, it was revelatory to see there were actions you can take in order to make more correct decisions.</p>
<h4 id="amazon-customer-obsession">Amazon: Customer Obsession<a class="headerlink" href="#amazon-customer-obsession" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>It’s all to easy in many organisations to get tangled in “how to deliver value” instead of “what would benefit the customer the most”. Without a meaningful conversation and continual reminders about what are the customer’s needs, what are their pain points, how would the customer experience our solution and so on, it is unlikely that the team is most effectively delivering customer value.</p>
<h4 id="amazon-deliver-result">Amazon: Deliver Result<a class="headerlink" href="#amazon-deliver-result" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<h4 id="netflix-impact">Netflix: Impact<a class="headerlink" href="#netflix-impact" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Both Netflix and Amazon have similar explanations for this core value - Leaders focus on results and can be relied upon to deliver key inputs. I must admit out of all the core values, these two makes me the most uncomfortable. It has generally been difficult for me to complete assignments on time and I am less results oriented in a work setting. However I understand the ability to reliably deliver results is crucial in a work environment and I will have to come up with strategies to mitigate this weakness.  </p>
<p>Looking through and comparing the company values of multiple companies (I also looked at Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Stripe - none of which had values as well articulated as Amazon or Netflix) was a revelatory process. I can see many of them being my strengths - curiosity, voicing my opinnions - but also where my weaknesses lie. After comparing these core values, I can focus on finding strategies to shore up my weaknesses. I hope you’ll be able to look into these core values yourself and discover what you need to improve on in order to succeed.</p>
